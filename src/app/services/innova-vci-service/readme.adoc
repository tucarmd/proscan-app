== Features using GUI VCI
[TIP]
====
There are some features using the GUI VCI process to get screen info and handle processes, such as:

* Special Test

* Actuator Test

* ...(update in next release)

The response received from VCI is screen info which is divided into some screen form

There are two types of items; one is LiveData item, one is option key items
